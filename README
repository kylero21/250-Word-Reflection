<i>"Consider how important it is for you to use your time well. To do so, you must live in an orderly, systematic fashion."</i><br>
<b>- St. John Baptist de La Salle</b><br>
<br><br><br>
This line of St. John Baptist de La Salle tells us that how important our time is. Not all the time everything is rushed. In life, there are no shortcuts. We should know how to value our time properly. Time management is what we need. For us to be successful, we should manage our time well. Let's make ourselves productive each day. Don't waste our time. <i>"To do so, you must live in an orderly, systematic fashion."</i> Let us not rush things. Do it slowly and one at a time. Don't let anyone distract you.<br><br>
Now that I'm a college student, my schedule is hardcore. Lot's of home work to do. And yet, I always start doing my work around 8 in the evening. My travelling time is not that long, it only take's me five minutes or less just to go home. I never consider doing my works early. <i>"Consider how important it is for you to use your time well.."</i> I always spend my time doing useless stuffs. Surf the net, watch videos, sleep, this is how I kill time. And after this, I'll do my home work. I lack concentration and time management. I was thinking about running as Dean's lister in our school. Aim for 3 is what I always say to my friends. But how will I able to aim for a GPA of 3 if my lifestyle is like this? I must learn how to use and value my time. I can't just always depend on stock knowledge. I'm not that also a smart person. I'm lucky enough to study in such an institution. And the only on how I can repay my parents for that is to study well and graduate. That's all. How will I make my parents proud if I don't study well? The decisions is ours. It is our decisions if we don't study or not. If we study we will learn more things and accomplish every assignments that we weill do, if we don't we will have a hard time on every lessons that we will go through.
